      "Final answer: Based on the information for the technique Brute Force subtechnique Password Guessing (T1110.001), here are some simple threat detection rules that you can use to monitor for potential brute force password guessing attacks:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Monitor Authentication Logs**: \n",
      "   - Monitor authentication logs for system and application login failures of valid accounts. \n",
      "   - If authentication failures are high, it may indicate a brute force attempt to gain access to a system using legitimate credentials.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Watch for High Number of Failed Login Attempts**:\n",
      "   - Set up alerts for a high number of failed login attempts within a short period of time.\n",
      "   - This could be an indicator of an adversary attempting a brute force attack to guess passwords.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Detect Unusual Login Patterns**:\n",
      "   - Look for unusual login patterns such as multiple failed login attempts followed by a successful login.\n",
      "   - Anomalies in login behavior could signify a brute force attack in progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitor Management Services over Commonly Used Ports**:\n",
      "   - Monitor management services over commonly used ports like SSH, Telnet, FTP, LDAP, RDP, HTTP, MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL, VNC, SNMP, etc.\n",
      "   - Detect repeated login attempts on these services as they are typically targeted in brute force attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Identify Account Lockouts**:\n",
      "   - Monitor for an unusual number of account lockouts, which may indicate an adversary's attempt to guess passwords and trigger account lockouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rules can help in detecting and mitigating brute force password guessing attacks. Implementing these rules in your security monitoring system can enhance your threat detection capabilities.\n",
